## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways in which you can contribute. Here are some ideas:

- Reporting Issues / Bugs
- Suggesting Improvements
- Stencil Templates for pretty markdown files
- Code 
  - bug fixes and new features that are within the main project scope
  - improving test coverage
- Documentation (README)

## Pull Request Process

Contributing requires you to create a pull request. Here's what we expect from you:

- Preferrably, discuss the changes beforehand by creating an issue. We don't want you to spend your time on something that might eventually not get accepted. It's better if we can talk about it before you dedicate your time.
- Be nice. We expect you to adhere to our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) at all times, whether if you're filing an issue, contributing code, or commenting on existing issues and pull requests.
- Provide enough information on the Pull Request's body - explain **why** and **how**.
- Code standards: we follow [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/).
- Make sure tests are passing. 

Here's what you can expect from us:

- Respectful and candid feedback ü§ù
- Help when you get stuck or need suggestions ü§≤
- We'll always try to accomodate your contribution, even if that means we'll make adjustments later üëç
- Gratitude!!! üôå
